# Sample data for GHD Drug Comparison app

- **old.xlsx** — Demo “prior period” (12 mo): overview + details sheets.
- **new.xlsx** — Demo “current period” (6 mo): overview + details sheets.

Used by the **Demo (sample data)** hospital option so the app works on Streamlit Community Cloud and when local hospital files are missing.

To regenerate: from project root run  
`python create_sample_data.py`  
(or `.venv/bin/python create_sample_data.py`).
